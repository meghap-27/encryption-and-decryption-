Website capable of performing encryption and decryption using multiple cryptographic 
algorithms, including the Caesar cipher, Vigenère cipher, and a simplified RSA system. 
The motivation behind this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and 
practical implementation by offering a user-friendly platform where learners can interact 
with, test, and understand the workings of various encryption techniques. By integrating 
different classical and foundational cryptographic methods into a single tool, the project 
aims to enhance conceptual clarity and hands-on skills in information security. 
The project is structured to encompass algorithm design, implementation, testing, and 
analysis. Users will be able to input text, choose an encryption algorithm, and observe 
both encrypted and decrypted results, thereby gaining insight into how transformations 
occur within different cryptographic schemes. The expected outcome is a functional, 
modular, and easily understandable program that can serve as a learning aid for students, 
educators, and beginners exploring the field of cybersecurity.
